# Traffic Sign Recognition
## INTRODUCTION 
   In this era of Artificial Intelligence, humans are more dependent on technology. You may be familiar with self-driving cars, where the vehicle itself behaves like a driver and does not need any human guidance to run on the road. This is not wrong to think about the safety aspectsâ€”a chance of significant accidents fro multinational companies like Google, Tesla, Uber, Ford, Audi, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and many more are working on automating vehicles. <br>
   
   In order to drive safely, you must abide by different traffic signs, such as traffic lights, turn left or right, speed restrictions, no passing of heavy vehicles, no entrance, children crossing, etc. Similarly, in order to reach accuracy, autonomous vehicles must comprehend these indicators and make choices. Traffic signs classification is a way for identifying the class to which a traffic sign belongs. <br>
   
   Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the Keras library, we will create a model for categorising the traffic signs seen in the image into various categories in this Deep Learning project.<br>
   
### PROBLEM STATEMENT 
    To improve raod safety and providing drivers
 
### OBJECTIVE 
   Objective of proposed solution is to assist drivers or automatic driving systems in detecting and recognizing traffic signs effectively.
